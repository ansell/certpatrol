TODO / WISHLIST
====/----------

 - convert validity dates to iso standard.
   the american mm/dd/yy order is very confusing.
   only iso using yyyy-mm-dd makes sense for everyone
    ? maybe even show how many days that is from today?
 + green/yellow/red indicator
    - if only the expiry has been updated, and the old
      certificate was to expire within the next 3 months,
      show green.
    - if the expiry was not due, but the issuer is still
      the same, show lime.
    - if the expiry was due, but the issuer has changed,
      show yellow.
    - if issuer has changed while expiry was not due, 
      show red.
 + preferences panel
    ? option to suppress certificate-added popups?
    ? option to wildcard-excempt annoying domains?
 + support for other protocols than https:
    + currently certpatrol in messengers like thunderbird only
      serves the purpose of handling https: links in e-mails
      and such. would be cooler if SMTP and IMAP certificates
      were actually checked.

== FEEDBACK ==

jmd says: hi guys
jmd asks: I suppose you probably heard about the whole CNNIC root ca in mozilla story ?

.. funny, i had twittered about just that couple minutes earlier ..

jmd says: I wondered if you would be open to bringing some evolution to the Certificat Patrol extension
jmd says: to better handle such a case
jmd says: *Actual* proof of misbehaving of CNNIC would be a cause for immediat removal of it and would have a large impact beyong that
jmd says: A user of Certificate Patrol certainly would be able to detect it easily
jmd says: but then it wouldn't be easy enough to report the information about it
jmd says: to maximilize the probability he would do it even if he's not expert
jmd says: .
jmd says: So I see two things that would help in certificat patrol
jmd says: - a button to copy all the information about the cert so that you can easily paste it in a mail to report that
jmd says: it would be the whole path of the certificate up to a root ca, so that expert could easily see from the content if a fake MITM certificate was involved or not
jmd says: - the possibility to configure a watch string in certificate patrol
jmd says: wenever you access a site that uses a certification path where one of the CA matches this string, you would get a specific warning
jmd says: so you could avoid specifically that CA
jmd says: even if it tried to hide itself behind a hierarchy of subca with innocent names
jmd says: and more obviously that by having to check the cert path
jmd says: each time you add a new SSL cert

> hello!
> better copy+paste .. ok
> .. the whole path.. i'm afraid firefox doesn't give us js access to that
> then again.. not sure




== VERSION 0.6 ==

This version has been improved to show and store the complete information about certificates, which makes it a lot more useful when a certificate is updated: You can now decide for yourself if expiry was due, if a change of issuer is acceptable, or if a phone call to the affected company is appropriate to get a voice confirmation of such a new certificate. We have tentatively added support for Thunderbird, Songbird, SeaMonkey, Mozilla and Fennec. Concerning Firefox, this version is a release candidate for Certificate Patrol 1.0 as this version implements all we expect from a 1.0.

== VERSION 0.7 ==

Allow to copy & paste data from pop-up.

== VERSION 1.0 ==

Nothing changed. Version 0.7 has proven to be super stable,
therefore we move from "release candidate" directly to 1.0.

== VERSION 1.1 ==

Some tweaks in the dialog GUI and a fix for a rare race condition
that has been reported to us by honeybee. Thanks!
Good luck with your factorbee!!!!  ;)
