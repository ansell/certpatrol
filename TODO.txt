 - OK. The display of the dates for Issue and Expiry are displayed wrongly. CP will write it like this: '2008.01.2010 00:00:00 (NaN days ahead)' while the FF display of the certificate writes it this way: '08.01.2010'
 - 208/21/2009 0:00:00 AM (231 days ago)

 - warn if hostname != common name for new certs
 + green/yellow/red threat level indicator
 ? use window load hook instead of DOM?
 ? examine certificate chain somehow?
 + jmd says: a button to copy all the information about the cert so that you
	     can easily paste it in a mail to report that
   (or just make the entire cert display copy+pastable?)
 ? jmd says: it would be the whole path of the certificate up to a root ca, so
	     that expert could easily see from the content if a fake MITM
	     certificate was involved or not
 + allow user to reject a new or changed certificate
 ? blacklist of untrustworthy CAs? (can't you just remove them?)
   jmd says: the possibility to configure a watch string wenever you access
	     a site that uses a certification path where one of the CA
	     matches this string, you would get a specific warning so you
	     could avoid specifically that CA even if it tried to hide itself
	     behind a hierarchy of subca with innocent names
 + preferences panel
    ? option to suppress certificate-added popups?
    ? option to wildcard-excempt annoying domains?
 + support for other protocols than https:
    + currently certpatrol in messengers like thunderbird only
      serves the purpose of handling https: links in e-mails
      and such. would be cooler if SMTP and IMAP certificates
      were actually checked.
 + detect forms in the document that carry an https: action and
   warn if the host mentioned in that action isn't in our database
   yet (= we haven't shown the certificate to our user yet)
 ? we could show expiry in locale text style
   but is it actually better than iso?




== VERSION 0.6 ==

This version has been improved to show and store the complete information about certificates, which makes it a lot more useful when a certificate is updated: You can now decide for yourself if expiry was due, if a change of issuer is acceptable, or if a phone call to the affected company is appropriate to get a voice confirmation of such a new certificate. We have tentatively added support for Thunderbird, Songbird, SeaMonkey, Mozilla and Fennec. Concerning Firefox, this version is a release candidate for Certificate Patrol 1.0 as this version implements all we expect from a 1.0.

== VERSION 0.7 ==

Allow to copy & paste data from pop-up.

== VERSION 1.0 ==

Nothing changed. Version 0.7 has proven to be super stable,
therefore we move from "release candidate" directly to 1.0.

== VERSION 1.1 ==

Some tweaks in the dialog GUI and a fix for a rare race condition
that has been reported to us by honeybee. Thanks!
Good luck with your factorbee!!!!  ;)

== VERSION 1.2 ==

Patrol now gives a few hints on what may be wrong about
a certificate change, like expiry not being due or issuer
having changed and it makes an estimate on a possible
threat level.

Also, validity dates are shown using ISO standard notation
as the American mm/dd/yy order used by X.509 is quite
confusing for everybody else.

== VERSION 1.2.3 ==

Expiration and issuance dates are also shown as number of
days in the future or past from now.
