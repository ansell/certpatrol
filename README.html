<blockquote>
Your web browser trusts a lot of certification authorities and chained
sub-authorities, and it does so blindly. "Subordinate certification
authorities" are a little known device: The root CAs in your browser can
delegate permission to issue certificates to an unlimited amount of
subordinate CAs (SCA) just by signing their certificate, not by
borrowing their precious private key to them. Even Wikipedia doesn't
mention this, nor do any public transparent listings exist of all the
sub-CAs that your browser trusts every day. It might be virtually
impossible to tell how many CAs you are trusting de-facto.

Revealing this and other inner workings of X.509 to end users is deemed
as being too difficult for them to handle. You however are an advanced
user, who wants to keep track on when certificates are updated and make
sure none of the many authorities you involuntarily need to trust to
have a working web browsing experience, abuses your trust allowing
someone to read into your HTTPS communications by means of a subtle man
in the middle attack. This used to be a very paranoid thing to expect to
happen, but in fact it is happening, so you may want to protect yourself.

You'll see certificate information pop up whenever you visit a
new https: website, including https://addons.mozilla.org for
example. "New" is anything Patrol hasn't seen and stored yet.

You are also prompted whenever a web site updates its certificate
and given the opportunity to compare the two certificates side by
side, line by line. See the screenshot for an example.

<b>Even if you do not fully understand what is shown to you, you
get a chance of distinguishing legitimate from suspicious changes.</b>
Here's a little list of things to look out for:

<ol>
<li>If the old certificate is about to expire (Validity / Expires On),
  it was necessary to replace it with a new one.</li>
<li>In most cases web sites keep using the same certification
  authority (Issued By) over time. Should the web site have changed
  its certification authority, make sure the old certificate was
  about to expire.</li>
<li>If all certificates you see are always issued by the same
  certification authority, you should be very suspicious.</li>
<li>In case of doubt install the Perspectives add-on to make further
  checks on the credibility of a certificate.</li>
</ol>

== DEVELOPER COMMENTS ==

For the interested ones, to manually trigger seeing a web site
replace its certificate, you can do one of these things:

<ol>
<li>Have an https web site yourself and change the certificate.</li>
<li>Manually have an address in /etc/hosts point to this or that
  https: IP address and add many security exceptions to Firefox
  in order for Patrol to even get to do its warning part.</li>
<li>Use an sqlite editor like the "SQLite Manager" add-on, edit
  the CertPatrol.sqlite file and modify any of the fingerprints
  of an https: website you have visited before. This way, Patrol
  will think it has seen that web site using a different certificate
  than it actually does, so as soon as you go to that web site it
  will warn you of an apparent change in certificate.</li>
</ol>
