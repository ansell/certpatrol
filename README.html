Your web browser trusts a lot of certification authorities and chained sub-authorities, and it does so blindly. "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_certificate_authorities">Subordinate or intermediate certification authorities</a>" are a little known device: The root CAs in your browser can delegate permission to issue certificates to an unlimited amount of subordinate CAs (<a href="http://www.linuxsecurity.com/component/option,com_dictionary/task,view/id,411/">SCA</a>) just by signing their certificate, not by borrowing their precious private key to them. You can even buy yourself such a CA from <a href="http://geotrust.com/enterprise-ssl-certificates/georoot/">GeoTrust</a> or <a href="http://www.sslshopper.com/article-trusted-root-signing-certificates.html">elsewhere</a>.

It is unclear how many intermediate certification authorities really exist, and yet each of them has god-like power to impersonate any https web site using a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack">Man in the Middle</a> (MITM) attack scenario. <a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/blog/sjs/web-security-trust-models">Researchers at Princeton are acknowledging this problem</a> and recommending Certificate Patrol.  Revealing the inner workings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.509">X.509</a> to end users is still deemed too difficult, but only getting familiar with this will really help you get in control. That's why Certificate Patrol gives you insight of what is happening.

<h2>Developer Comments.</h2>

You'll see certificate information pop up whenever you visit a
new https: website, including https://addons.mozilla.org for
example. "New" is anything Patrol hasn't seen and stored yet.

You are also prompted whenever a web site updates its certificate
and given the opportunity to compare the two certificates side by
side, line by line. See the screenshot for an example.

<b>Even if you do not fully understand what is shown to you, you
get a chance of distinguishing legitimate from suspicious changes.</b>
Here's a little list of things to look out for:
<ol>
<li>If the old certificate is about to expire (Validity / Expires On),
  it was necessary to replace it with a new one.</li>
<li>In most cases web sites keep using the same certification
  authority (Issued By) over time. Should the web site have changed
  its certification authority, make sure the old certificate was
  about to expire.</li>
<li>If all certificates you see are always issued by the same
  certification authority, you should be very suspicious.</li>
<li>In case of doubt install the Perspectives add-on to make further
  checks on the credibility of a certificate.</li>
</ol>

Originally conceived, planned and continously refined by <a href="psyc://psyced.org/~lynX">the lynX</a> (Carlo v. Loesch).

<h2>Testing the add-on.</h2>

For the interested ones, to manually trigger seeing a web site
replace its certificate, you can do one of these things:

<ol>
<li>Have an https web site yourself and change the certificate.</li>
<li>Manually have an address in /etc/hosts point to this or that
  https: IP address and add many security exceptions to Firefox
  in order for Patrol to even get to do its warning part.</li>
<li>Use an sqlite editor like the "SQLite Manager" add-on, edit
  the CertPatrol.sqlite file and modify any of the fingerprints
  of an https: website you have visited before. This way, Patrol
  will think it has seen that web site using a different certificate
  than it actually does, so as soon as you go to that web site it
  will warn you of an apparent change in certificate.</li>
</ol>
